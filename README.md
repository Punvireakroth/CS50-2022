# Computer Science Concept

These material are take from CS50 2022

## Week 2

- C use compiler to convert source code to machine code
- make is actually run a program call clang
- a.out is the default name convention when we compile our code

### Debugging

- We canâ€™t write the eniter program with bug free there must be bugs along the way when we write a program
- In order to solve this, we have some processes to help
  - Use printf function
  - Use debug50 ( Debugger )

```c
debug50 ./buggy.c ( name of the program )
```

    - What the debugger do is to walk through our program step by step

- Use Rubber duck debugging ( Talking through with inanimate animal rubber duck )
