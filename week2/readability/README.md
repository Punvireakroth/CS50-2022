A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text.
Coleman-Liau index `index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`
where `L` is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and `S` is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
